# Problem Set 3
## What to Do
1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click ***Rebuild now***
3. Submit [Plurality](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/plurality/)
4. Submit one of:
   - [Runoff](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/runoff/), if feeling less comfortable
   - [Tideman](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/tideman/), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Runoff and Tideman, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## Advice
- Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/3/)’s sandboxes.
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and

```
make plurality
```

is yielding errors, try running

```
help50 make plurality
```

instead!
