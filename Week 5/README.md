# Problem Set 5
## What to Do
1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit [Speller](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/5/speller/)

## Advice
- Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 5](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/5/).
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `speller`, and

```
make speller
```

is yielding errors, try running

```
help50 make speller
```

instead!
