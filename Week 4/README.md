# Problem Set 4

## What to Do

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild** now
3. Submit one of:
   - [this version of Filter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/filter/less/) if feeling less comfortable
   - [this version of Filter](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/filter/more/) if feeling more comfortable
4. Submit [Recover](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/recover/)

If you submit both versions of Filter, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## Advice
- Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/4/).
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `filter`, and

```
make filter
```

is yielding errors, try running

```
help50 make filter
```

instead!
